In this code, analyzed the XMLfiles (in bulk), did data analysis and extracted required/useful information using Python.

Following was the problem statement - 

Do Data Analysis on the files provided and Build a travel record for Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for the messages in at least 20 of the files (each of which contains the messages for a month).  To do this, first find the messages sent by Kissinger. For each such message, print the date and the address of the sending organization to a file named Kissinger_Travel.txt, in increasing date order (i.e., oldest messages first).  Examining this file, you should be able to see where Kissinger as visiting each time he sent a message (although the abbreviations used in the sender's addresses might be a bit cryptic).
